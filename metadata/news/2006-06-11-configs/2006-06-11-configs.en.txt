As of Paludis 0.3, certain keys in repository configuration files have
been changed. You will see deprecation warnings if you are using any of
these keys.

The 'eclassdir' key is now 'eclassdirs'. If only a single eclass
directory is being used, the value format does not change. However, if
multiple eclass directories are desired (which was not possible in
earlier versions), they should be specified as a space separated list.
Priority is given to eclasses in directories later in the list, but the
ECLASSDIR variable is set from the first value.

The 'profiledir' key is now 'profilesdir'. In only a single profile
directory is being used, the value format does not change. However, if
multiple profile directories are desired, they should be specified in a
space separated list. Priority is given to values defined later in the
list.

The old keys will continue to work (albeit with a warning displayed) for
long enough to give users ample time to make the transition.
