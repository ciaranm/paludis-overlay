As of version 0.22, Paludis supports carrying out certain tasks (e.g.
compiling and fetching packages) using reduced privileges, similar to
Portage's userpriv feature. If you have previously used an older Paludis
version, you will need to make certain changes to enable this
functionality:

* The 'buildroot' directory for ebuild format repositories (by default,
  '/var/tmp/paludis') must be owned by the group 'paludisbuild', and
  must have permissions 'rwsrwsr-x'. The easiest way to set this up is:

    rm -fr /var/tmp/paludis
    mkdir /var/tmp/paludis
    chgrp paludisbuild /var/tmp/paludis
    chmod g+rwx /var/tmp/paludis
    chmod +s /var/tmp/paludis

* The 'distdir' directory for any ebuild format repositories must also
  be owned by the group 'paludisbuild' and must have permissions
  'rwsrwsr-x'.

* The Paludis configuration directory must be readable by the group
  'paludisbuild'. This means that the root user's home directory should
  no longer be used for configuration.

The user and group used for reduced privileges is controlled via the
confdir/environment.conf file. The key 'reduced_username' is used to
control the username; this user's default group is used for permissions.
The default value for this key is 'paludisbuild', and the default group
for the 'paludisbuild' user is also named 'paludisbuild'. To disable
userpriv functionality, use the username 'root'.
